/*N monkeys are invited to a party where they start dancing. They dance in a circular formation, very similar to a Gujarati Garba or a Drum Circle. The dance requires the monkeys to constantly change positions after every 1 second.

The change of position is not random & you, in the audience, observe a pattern. Monkeys are very disciplined & follow a specific pattern while dancing.

Consider N = 6, and an array monkeys = {3,6,5,4,1,2}.

This array (1-indexed) is the dancing pattern. The value at monkeys[i], indicates the new of position of the monkey who is standing at the ith position.

Given N & the array monkeys[ ], find the time after which all monkeys are in the initial positions for the 1st time.

Constraints

1<=t<=10 (test cases)
1<=N<=10000 (Number of monkeys)

Input Format

First line contains single integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case is as follows â€“
Integer N denoting the number of monkeys.
Next line contains N integer denoting the dancing pattern array, monkeys[].

Output

t lines,
Each line must contain a single integer T, where T is the minimum number of seconds after which all the monkeys are in their initial position.
